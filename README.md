This is the source code for my personal website, hosted at [bsoyka.me](https://bsoyka.me).

My site is built on [Astro](https://astro.build/) and Svelte, styled with [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev/), and deployed with [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
I use a card-based design system loosely based on the containers in a [bento box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento).
Notably, my site is mobile-first, with a heavy focus on responsive and accessible design for all screen sizes.

Some inspiration came from the personal website of [Gianmarco Cavallo](https://gianmarcocavallo.com/)â€”thanks for the ideas!

Contributions are appreciated within reason. I want to showcase this project as my own, so I generally won't accept any significant outside contributions.
